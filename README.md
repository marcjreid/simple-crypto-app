<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

This is a simple app that looks at the price history of cryptocurrencies and shows which ones show a potential buy signal.
The way it deos this is buy comparing the 7-day and 25-day moving averages and seeing if there is a crossover. 
It also shows the price history of the chosen currency with the moving average and MACD analysis lines.
